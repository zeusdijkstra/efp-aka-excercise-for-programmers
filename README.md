## About This Repository

This project contains exercises from the book *"Exercises for Programmers"*.

It’s mainly for practice and learning purposes — nothing fancy or production-ready. I’m using it to improve my skills and stay consistent.

If you’d like to follow along, I highly recommend getting a copy of the book and working through the exercises yourself. It’s a great hands-on way to sharpen your programming skills.

Feel free to explore the code and join the journey
